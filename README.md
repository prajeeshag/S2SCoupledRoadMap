# Development of the AP regional coupled model for S2S prediction

- [ ] Domain, Grid and Resolution
	- [ ] Domain -
	- [ ] Grid - Lat-Lon (Cyllindrical equidistant) for both Ocean and Atmosphere
	- [ ] Resolution - 0.036 degrees (<4km) for both Ocean and Atmosphere

- [ ] Setting up WRF and MITgcm. Make standalone hindcasts. Evaluate against the S2S models (Feb-March 2023)
- [ ] Setting up the coupled model and make test simulations (March-April 2023)
- [ ] Developing an end-to-end automated workflow using [CYLC](https://cylc.github.io) workflow engine (April-May 2023)
- [ ] Run hindcasts and evaluate against the standalone S2S models (June-August 2023)
- [ ] Optimize the coupled model for performance (September 2023)
- [ ] [Develop an automated evaluation framework] (October 2023)
